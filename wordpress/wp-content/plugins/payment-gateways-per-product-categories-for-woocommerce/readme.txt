Increase profit margins for your products by deciding which payment gateways to show in WooCommerce checkout page depending on selected product, product category, or product tag being in cart.

== Description ==

If you want to control (show / hide) specific payment gateways for some products, this plugin will give you a full control on what payments to be used based on product tag, category.

**Customize Payment Gateways per Products** plugin lets you show WooCommerce gateway only if there is product of selected **category or tag** in cart. Alternatively you can hide gateway by selected category or tag.

The plugin becomes very handy when you have specific product / category that has low profit margins, and specific payment gateways (PayPal for example) that charge high transaction fees, you can then force buyers to select payment gateways that gets you better profit.

If you want more control over specific products (rather than tags or category), then our premium [Payment Gateways per Products for WooCommerce Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/payment-gateways-per-product-for-woocommerce/) plugin is for you, this version has options to show/hide the gateways on **per product** basis (i.e. instead of on per product category / tag basis).
