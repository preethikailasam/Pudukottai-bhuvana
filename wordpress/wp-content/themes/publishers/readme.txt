A theme for publishers like magazines, blogs, and other content sites.

== Description ==

A theme for publishers like magazines, blogs, and other content sites.

I've been an editor for over a decade and have managed dozens of writers. Publishers is an agressive and opinionated theme that imposes a lot of guidelines and controls to make managing multiple writers and editing their work more sane.

**Recommended Settings & Notes**

* This theme utilizes a [companion plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishers/)
* For the best experience, install recommended plugins after activating the theme (you'll be prompted with my recommendations automatically and you can choose to install them or dimiss the notice)
* This theme's design excludes a sidebar intentionally
* This theme's design is based on all posts being assigned a Featured Image
* Use intervals of 3 (3, 6, 9, etc.) for # of posts to show on the blog page under *Settings > Reading*
* When setting up the Account Menu, only set one top-level item (use `#` for the URL), then all other added menu items should be nested under it
* When setting up the Social Menu, simply add the links to your social media profile, and respective icons will be added (currently supports: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube)

**Extra Features When Using Companion Plugin**

* Add SEO, social media, and schema tags
* If you would like to enable the dark mode feature, simply add a new menu item to any of your menus (and give it the class *lights* and `#` for the URL)
* You can also add the dark/light mode switcher as a button anywhere you like and style it with `<span class="lights"><a href="#" class="button black">Lights</a></span>`
* Use the shortcode `[non-member]...[/non-member]` to show content to logged-out visitors only
* Use the shortcode `[member]...[/member]` to show content to logged-in members only
* Use the shortcode `[access capability="read"]...[/access]` to show content to users with [specific capabilities](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/)
* Use the shortcode `[share]` to add share buttons to posts
* You'll find new optional profile fields: Public Email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, and Twitch
* Add a body class for the logged-in user role
* Improved post editor tools/buttons
* Add subtitles/sub-headers to posts
* Feature posts on homepage
* Show a link to editor notes and guidelines in the post editor
* Uploaded images automatically have titles and alts generated
* Stop contributors from being able to delete files
* Receive an email for guest post submissions, and guests receive a follow-up email based on whether you published or deleted their submission
* Uncluttered admin and post editor screens for authors
* The /author/ slug in URLs is rewritten to /writer/
* New users are automatically logged in when they register
* Improved images handling: unnecessary files sizes aren't generated, thumbnails are generated for RSS feeds
* Users are sortable by registration date
* Records user IPs to assist with anti-spam measures and security whitelisting
* More to come...
