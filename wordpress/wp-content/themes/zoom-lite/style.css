Developers Recommendation
To make it easy to update your theme, you should NOT add your custom css rules to this file. Instead use
a child theme to add your styles. You can copy a style from /assets/css/main.css and paste in the child
theme's style.css and it will override the style in this file. You have been warned! :)

If you don't know what a child theme is, you really want to spend 5 minutes learning how to use child themes in WordPress, you won't regret it :) !
